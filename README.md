# KUEHNE + NAGEL
# Contact List Challenge!

**Task statement**
Create a simple "contact list" web application that allows:

-   Listing people (name and photo)
    
-   Searching by name
    
-   Paging
   
 Initial list should be one-time populated with people.csv attached. Contact addition/removal/edit is out of scope of this task.

# Technical clarification
-   Spring Boot
    
-   Any build system
    
-   Consider it as an enterprise-grade application (it will stay there for years, will
    
    be extended and maintained)
    
-   As a result it should be DB-ready, meaning it should be little-to-zero effort to
    
    make this implementation use some enterprise DB (e.g. Oracle)
    
-   For frontend you can use any technology
    
-   Do not care about page design
# Expected outcome

A repository at your GitHub account/local KN Git from where you can clone and run the web app with little-to-zero efforts.

## How to use

In order to run this application you need to install two tools: **Docker** & **Docker Compose**.

An entire application can be ran with a single command in a terminal:

```
$ docker-compose up -d

```

If you want to stop it use following command:

```
$ docker-compose down
```
